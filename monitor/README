To build: 

 cd src/cmd
 go build -o monitor

To merge config: 
  cd resources/production
  cat config_bare.yaml check/*.check > config.yaml

For each check there is a corresponding flux query.
The indentation in the check is CRITICAL. They are simply parts of a YAML map[string]struct under the 'checks' key.  
They are separated into check files to be merged by the above 'cat' command to simplify editing and ease reading.
